# Claude Advanced Plugins

A comprehensive collection of **48 advanced plugins** (55+ slash commands) for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) covering cybersecurity, game development, frontend, backend, reverse engineering, and AI productivity.

Each plugin installs as a **custom slash command** — type `/command-name` in Claude Code to activate.

## Quick Install

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CyberSecurityUP/ClaudeAdvancedPlugins.git
cd ClaudeAdvancedPlugins

# 2. Run the installer
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Install by Category

```bash
# Install only what you need
./install.sh -c security          # All offensive security plugins
./install.sh -c blueteam          # All blue team / defense plugins
./install.sh -c gamedev           # Unity, Unreal, Godot, Three.js
./install.sh -c frontend          # Animations, DOM, 3D, performance
./install.sh -c reverse           # Binary, malware, firmware, protocol RE
./install.sh -c compliance        # SCRMS, SOC 2, ISO 27001, vendor risk, audits

# Combine multiple categories
./install.sh -c security -c blueteam -c reverse

# Interactive mode — pick what you want
./install.sh --interactive
```

### Other Commands

```bash
./install.sh --list               # See all plugins and commands
./install.sh --status             # Check what's installed
./install.sh --update             # Update installed plugins
./install.sh --uninstall          # Remove all plugins
./install.sh -p pentest-ad        # Install one specific plugin
./install.sh --help               # Full usage guide
```

### Install Target (Claude Code vs other AI tools)

By default, plugins install as Claude Code slash commands. The installer also supports the **Agent Skills** format used by other AI tools (skills are placed in `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter).

```bash
./install.sh                          # default: target=claude  → ~/.claude/commands/
./install.sh --target agents          # target=agents          → ~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
./install.sh --target both            # install to both locations
./install.sh -t agents -c security    # combine with category/plugin flags
```

`uninstall.sh` removes from both targets by default, or pass `--target claude` / `--target agents` to scope it.

### Plugin Layouts

The installer handles two plugin layouts in `plugins/`:

- **Legacy**: `plugins/<name>/commands/<cmd>.md` — one or more bare slash-command markdown files. Used by all of the original ~49 plugins.
- **Skill-rooted**: `plugins/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter, plus optional `commands/`, `references/`, `examples/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` subdirectories. Used by the `compliance` category.

**Install behavior per layout:**

| Target | Legacy | Skill-rooted |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | each `commands/*.md` → `~/.claude/commands/` | `SKILL.md` body + `references/` + `examples/` + `scripts/` are inlined into a single `~/.claude/commands/<plugin-name>.md`, plus any `commands/*.md` installed individually. Binary `assets/` are listed by name only — get the real files via the `agents` target. |
| `agents` | each `commands/*.md` wrapped with frontmatter → `~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/SKILL.md` | entire plugin directory copied to `~/.agents/skills/<plugin-name>/` preserving full structure |

### How Plugins Work in Claude Code

1. **Install Claude Code** (if you haven't): `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. **Run the installer** above — it copies `.md` files to `~/.claude/commands/`
3. **Open Claude Code**: `claude`
4. **Type any slash command**: `/pentest-ad enumerate this Active Directory domain`
5. Claude Code loads the plugin prompt and becomes a specialist in that domain

> Plugins are just Markdown files with expert system prompts. No dependencies, no servers, no config.

## How It Works

Claude Code supports [custom slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) stored as Markdown files in `~/.claude/commands/`. Each plugin is a carefully crafted system prompt that activates specialized expertise when invoked.

The install script simply copies the command `.md` files to your Claude commands directory. No dependencies, no runtime, no configuration.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed
